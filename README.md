## Sqrt2

Last Semester we worked on Newton's method of finding square roots

[https://github.com/g00387822/pands-problem-sheet/blob/master/5-squareroot.py](https://github.com/g00387822/pands-problem-sheet/blob/master/5-squareroot.py)

I tried to reuse the code from last Semester to find the Square Root of 2

Unfortunately Python has its limitations on the amount of Decimal places that it will show [read more](https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/floatingpoint.html)

After much research and frustration, I consolidated what I had learned and drafted in code, and asked the question on StackOverFlow

### Is there a way to create more decimal points on Python without importing a library/module?

I received the support I needed to be able to complete the task, I have provided references to the code of others, and have worked towards consolidating the code into one function sqrt2
